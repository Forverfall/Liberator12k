# Welcome to #Liberator12k project!

Everyone's Favorite 3D Printed Shotgun.

Making a Gun
----------
Impatient? Slow down there, Hoss - this is a work in progress, but here's the basics:

This project contains more than one gun design; a pistol and a long-gun configuration.

Each of these guns can be configured to whatever materials may be around.

Start Here: \#Liberator12k Shotgun

And Here: \#L12k Pistol 22LR

Designing New Guns
---------------
The real "secret sauce" of this project, is the software library I developed
during the design process of these guns. I tried a lot of different ideas,
and what I came away with, is an OpenSCAD software library chock-full of
useful *configurable* objects.

If you browse through the code, you'll see the project has been grouped into
major functional areas:

  * Tooling - Printable tools for gun making
  * Vitamins - Store-bought parts, nut and bolts, etc.
  * Lower - Grip with a simple trigger.
  * Upper - Different uppers that work with the lower (maybe).
  * Ammo - Printable Ammunition
  * Meta - 3D modeling-specific code
  * Toys - Things I've tried and thrown away (maybe)

There are more directories than mentioned above, but this should give you a taste of what's in here.


ART AT YOUR OWN RISK
====================

Beware, this software can literally kill you and others.

Building your own firearm can be **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**. The necessary safety precautions and procedures *are not fully documented here*.

Before holding or shouldering any home made firearm, repeated testing from behind a solid barrier (e.g. several feet of dirt) is a must. Material failure is still possible, even after extensive testing.

One of the major goals of this project has been to improve on the safety of the sketchy 3/4" Schedule 40 pipe shotgun. Seriously - those are sketchy AF.
